# spark-realtime-chatbot

A voice + vision AI assistant running locally on DGX Spark — streaming speech recognition, a single joint vision-language-reasoning model, and text-to-speech, all on a single GB10.

![Demo](demo.png)

**Highlights**
- **Single joint model**: Qwen3.6-35B-A3B handles text, vision, and reasoning (no separate VLM/reasoner)
- **Ultra-low latency**: ~300ms voice turns, ~900ms video turns (warm, GB10)
- **Fully local**: Ollama on host, Whisper ASR, Kokoro TTS — no cloud dependencies
- **Agentic**: streaming multi-turn tool-call loop (filesystem, Python sandbox, web search, memory)
- **Face recognition**: DeepFace enrollment + identification in video-call mode

**Benchmarked on DGX Spark (warm, Q4_K_M Qwen3.6-35B-A3B via Ollama)**

| Path | TTFT (median) | End-to-end (median) |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| Voice turn (effort=none) | ~225 ms | ~365 ms |
| Video turn (image+text, effort=none) | ~880 ms | ~1340 ms |
| Tool-call roundtrip | ~840 ms | ~840 ms |
| Reasoning turn (effort=high, ~4k chars thinking) | — | ~20 s |

Reproduce: `python3 bench/bench.py --trials 5 --out bench/after.json`, then `python3 bench/diff.py bench/baseline.json bench/after.json`.

## Quick Start

### 1. Serve Qwen3.6 with Ollama

```bash
# Install Ollama (if needed): https://ollama.com/download
ollama pull qwen3.6:35b-a3b
ollama serve  # runs on http://localhost:11434
```

Sanity check:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3.6:35b-a3b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"max_tokens":20,"reasoning_effort":"none"}' | jq .
```

### 2. Run the chatbot (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kedarpotdar-nv/spark-realtime-chatbot
cd spark-realtime-chatbot
docker build -t spark-realtime-chatbot .
docker run --gpus all --net host -it --init \
    -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
    spark-realtime-chatbot
```

Ollama is reached at `host.docker.internal:11434` (or `localhost:11434` with `--net host`).

### 3. Run the chatbot (Python, dev mode)

```bash
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./launch-https.sh --local-asr
```

Open **https://localhost:8443**. Accept the self-signed cert and allow the microphone.

## Configuration

All defaults live in `config.py` and can be overridden via environment variables.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LLM_SERVER_URL` | `http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `LLM_MODEL` | `qwen3.6:35b-a3b` | Same model for text + vision |
| `LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` | `none` | `none` / `low` / `high` — `none` gates out `<think>` on the voice path |
| `VLM_SERVER_URL` / `VLM_MODEL` | same as LLM | Vision shares the model |
| `REASONING_EFFORT` | `high` | For the deep-reasoning agent tool only |
| `ASR_MODE` | `api` | `api` (separate whisper server) or `local` (in-process) |
| `ASR_MODEL` | `Systran/faster-whisper-small.en` | Whisper model |
| `KOKORO_VOICE` | `af_bella` | TTS voice |
| `TTS_OVERLAP` | `false` | Start TTS while LLM still streaming |

## Architecture

```
Browser ──► FastAPI (server.py) ──► Ollama :11434  (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B)
                │
                ├── ASR      (faster-whisper, local or API)
                ├── TTS      (Kokoro)
                ├── Face     (DeepFace)
                └── Tools    (read/write_file, run_python, web_search, memory, agents)
```

**Agent loop.** When Qwen3.6 emits tool calls, the server executes them (in parallel for ≥2 calls), appends the `tool_result` messages, and re-streams the model until no more tool calls are emitted, capped at 4 iterations. TTS announces *"working on it…"* immediately when a long-running tool fires; a user barge-in cancels the in-flight generation.

**Single model for everything.** The December 2025 demo used one llama.cpp server for Qwen3-VL and another for Nemotron reasoning. This upgrade collapses both onto one Qwen3.6-35B-A3B process: 3B active parameters, Q4_K_M, ~24 GB resident. Text turns run with `reasoning_effort=none` for realtime TTFT; the reasoning agent flips to `effort=high` for deliberate analysis.

Key files:
- `server.py` — FastAPI WS handlers, voice/video paths, tool-call loop
- `clients/llm.py` — `LlamaCppClient` (OpenAI-compat streaming) + `ReasoningClient`
- `clients/vlm.py` — vision helper, same backend
- `clients/asr.py`, `clients/tts.py`, `clients/face.py` — supporting services
- `tools.py` — tool schema + execution
- `prompts.py` — system prompts (voice, video, reasoning variants)
- `static/` — frontend

## Usage

1. **Connect**: the app auto-connects on load.
2. **Choose Mode**: voice call or video call.
3. **Voice Input**: hands-free with VAD, or hold SPACE for push-to-talk.
4. **Enable Tools**: check agents in the sidebar; the LLM can now call them.
5. **Face Recognition**: in video mode, say *"remember my face as <name>"*.

### Things to try

- **Whiteboard → README**: draw a system diagram, show it in video mode, say "convert this into a markdown README."
- **Architecture review**: show a diagram, ask "what's missing from this design?"
- **Fashion advisor**: "am I dressed appropriately for a board meeting?"
- **Face recognition**: say "remember my face as Alex," end the call, start a new one — the bot greets you by name.
